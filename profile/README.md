# Hi there üëã

## üçø Technical questions discussion board. This board is PUBLIC.

The platform that we are going use is the Github discussions board. The board can be found here <https://github.com/c0c0n3/kitt4sme.live/discussions>

The actions must respect the following guidelines when they decide to ask a question:
- Be clear and specific: When asking a question, be as clear and specific as possible. This will help to ensure that your question is understood and that the answer is relevant to your needs.
- Be respectful: Always treat others with respect and kindness, even if you disagree with their perspective or approach. Remember that we are all working towards the same goal.
- Be patient: Allow others time to respond to your question. Remember that everyone has their own workload and may not be able to respond immediately.
- Be concise: Try to keep your questions concise and focused. This will help to ensure that your question is answered quickly and accurately.
Test first, then ask: Please first study the documentation, try to make it work by yourselves, and then ask a question. Avoid bombing the platform with questions about everything. 
- The discussion board is public: The github discussion board is public. So please avoid including private business information in your questions.
